- ✅ Use stop losses
- ✅ Start with small positions
- ✅ Only trade capital you can afford to lose

### System Limitations
- Uses historical data (no real-time execution)
- Data from yfinance (free but may have delays)
- Backtests assume perfect execution
- Transaction costs not included by default

### Legal
- Not financial advice
- For educational/research purposes
- Past performance ≠ future results
- Consult licensed advisor for investment decisions

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient data" Error
- **Solution**: Increase days (try 365+ for ML strategies)
- **Why**: ML needs more training data

### "No data available" Error
- **Solution**: Check ticker symbol spelling
- **Solution**: Verify internet connection
- **Solution**: Try different symbol

### Slow Performance
- **Normal for**:
  - Optimized ML (option 25): 5-15 minutes
  - Walk-forward analysis: 10-30 minutes
  - Monte Carlo: 5-10 minutes
- **Fast for**:
  - Simple strategies: <30 seconds
